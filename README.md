## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it messes some stuff.

open up a Command Prompt/PowerShell or Terminal, type `haxelib install hmm`

after it finishes, simply type `haxelib run hmm install` in order to install all the needed libraries for *Psych Engine!*

## HXVlc in Linux:

Use the following commands:

```cmd
sudo apt-get install libvlc-dev
sudo apt-get install libvlccore-dev
sudo apt-get install vlc-bin
sudo apt-get install glibc-source
sudo apt-get install libidn12
sudo apt-get install libidn-dev
```

It doesn't matter if you already have some of those libraries, just use the command and retry the compile command (``lime test linux``?)

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.xml`

inside `Project.xml`, you will find several variables to customize Psych Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `"VIDEOS_ALLOWED"` or comment it out by wrapping the line in XML-like comments, like this `<!-- YOUR_LINE_HERE -->`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.xml` file

* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.
  * You can use gf and mom notes to make the second opponent or gf play animations!
* You can now use up to 14 values for each event!

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod
